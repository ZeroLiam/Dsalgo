Pronounced as "dis-all-go". Data Structures, Algorithms, and any fun stuff to practice. This is my safe space to learn and fail.

Most exercises come from `JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass: The Missing Computer Science and Coding Interview Bootcamp` by Colt Steele, available in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/).
